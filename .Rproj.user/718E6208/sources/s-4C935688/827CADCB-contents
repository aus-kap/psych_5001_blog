What are contingency judgements? In order to understand this better, I will attempt to put part of this article in my own words while reading. The article by Lorraine G. Allan starts out by mentioning that two models are most popular in regard to explaining how contingency information is acquired. The are rule-based models and associative models. The article evaluates both, revealing different from expected results for rule-based models. 
The first paragraph of the article mentions that the topic of covariation between two variables (and its influence on conditioned responses or operant behavior) is of particular interest of study with animals. Conditioned responses are tied to pavlovian conditioning. Operant behavior is tied to operant conditioning. Rule-based models propose that organisms apply rules to determine the probability of events occurring. Associative models propose that contingency learning is the result of Pavlovian association. The article seeks to evaluate how these models apply to human contingency judgements. In the “Contingency-Judgement Tasks” section, it is stated that in the simplest case, contingency judgments have two binary (two values each) variables. Different tasks have been used to test subjects even with only two binary variables. During experiments, subjects are asked to determine the relationship between the two variables, and this is the definition of a contingency judgement. The relationship is usually assessed using a rating scale, unidirectional or bidirectional. The article assesses several different contingency judgement experiments, in which participants are asked to perform a task, and whether they choose to perform the task or not results in a different outcome (such as a video game in which firing or not firing a gun at a tank results in the tank being either intact or destroyed). However, Allan ultimately concludes that there is currently no set rule to describe human judgements of the contingency between binary variables. The “Associative Models” section describes that early research involved only one input and output variable while more recent studies involve multiple input variables. The research with multiple input variables found that contingency judgements are influenced by the multiple input variables. This is more indicative of associative models being viable explanations for contingency judgements in this context. It is further stated that originally, learning theorists thought that conditioned-unconditioned stimulus pairings were sufficient to cause associative learning, however, this was disproven in the 1960s. One proposition is that the unconditioned stimulus must also impose some “mental work” in order for an animal to achieve associative learning, and that this must be somewhat unpredictable to the animal. Overall, a contingency judgement is one’s perception of whether their actions produced a particular outcome.
